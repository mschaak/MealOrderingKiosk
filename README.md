# SELT 2019 GROUP 6 - Dining+ Meal Ordering System

Inspired by University Housing and Dining, we sought to create a web-based dining application that allows students to order meals digitally. Students are able to log in, view the day's scheduled meals, and filter meals by their dietary needs. Administrators are able to see meals as they are ordered, manage available dishes, and schedule the week's menu.

## Developer's Notes

### Test Login Criteria
Student Email:  Jdoe@test.com       Student Password: password  
Admin Email:    rpreston@test.com   Admin Password:   PASSWORD123  

### Text Notifications  
A text notification system was implemented to notify students when their orders have been received or completed. Due to the nature of this project, we used a free trial account which requires phone numbers to be authenticated before they can be used. Therefore, only the phone numbers listed above can receive notifications in this version of our project.  

### Email Verification
An email verification system is used when users create an account for the first time. Note that the verification email will be sent from mrshsupport@mrshmellowengineering.com and may be found in your spam folder.
